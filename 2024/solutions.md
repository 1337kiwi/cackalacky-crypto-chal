wav file is encoded into the image using https://github.com/7thSamurai/steganography 
password is saren


The program operates by first randomly generating a _128-bit Password Salt_ and a _128-bit AES Initialization Vector_ by reading binary data from **/dev/urandom**. It then uses that _Password Salt_ as a parameter in generating an encryption key, by using **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA-256** on a user inputted string. A **CRC32** hash of the file to embed is then calculated, and stored in the header to act as a checksum for the validity of the data. It then pads the binary data of the file to embed using the **PKCS #7** algorithm, followed by actually encrypting both the header and the padded data, with **AES-256** in **CBC Mode**, using the previously generated _Initialization Vector_. Now the data is actually encoded inside the image by first picking a random offset, and then going through each bit of data and storing it inside the actual image pixel data, which it accomplishes by setting the _Least-Significant-Bit_ of each channel byte of each pixel.

# Step 3
I repost fekie's red panda with the phrase "These animals belong in siberia"

fekie responds, we flame each other back and forth 
I drop some like "Even zuko is smarter than you!" with a picture of zuko
- last message, fekie says "This is gonna drop harder than meet the grahams. I'm exposing you. We'll see who belongs in siberia"
	fekie posts an encrypted message that points to a website after the red panda post
